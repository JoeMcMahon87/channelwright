## Channel Templates

### Default Template (`default_template`)

The default template creates a comprehensive set of channels for most RPG campaigns:

**Public Channels** (accessible to campaign members):
- `#general` - Text channel for general campaign discussion
- `#character-sheets` - Forum channel for sharing and discussing character sheets
- `#session-recaps` - Forum channel for posting session summaries and recaps
- `#voice-chat` - Voice channel for game sessions

**Private Channels** (guild owner and GM only):
- `#gm-notes` - Text channel for GM planning and notes
- `#gm-resources` - Forum channel for GM-only resources and discussions

### Minimal Template (`minimal_template`)

A smaller template for simple campaigns:

**Public Channels:**
- `#campaign-chat` - Main campaign discussion
- `#voice-session` - Game session voice channel

**Private Channels:**
- `#gm-planning` - GM planning space

## Permission System

### Role Hierarchy

The bot creates a role hierarchy for each campaign:

1. **Guild Owner** - Full access to all channels and management
2. **{Campaign Name} Members** - Access to public campaign channels
3. **@everyone** - No access to campaign channels

### Channel Permissions

**Public Channels:**
- Guild Owner: Full permissions
- Campaign Members Role: Read, Send Messages, Connect (for voice)
- @everyone: No access

**Private Channels:**
- Guild Owner: Full permissions
- Campaign Members Role: No access
- @everyone: No access

### Bot Requirements

The bot must have the following permissions to function properly:

- **Manage Channels** - To create categories and channels
- **Manage Roles** - To create and assign campaign member roles
- **View Channels** - To see existing server structure
- **Send Messages** - To respond to commands
- **Use Slash Commands** - To register and respond to slash commands

**Important:** The bot's role must be positioned above any roles it creates in the server's role hierarchy.

## Error Handling

### Common Error Messages

**"Campaign name cannot be empty!"**
- The campaign name parameter is required and cannot be blank

**"Campaign name is too long!"**
- Campaign names must be 100 characters or less

**"A campaign named 'X' already exists!"**
- Each campaign name must be unique within a server

**"I don't have permission to create channels and roles!"**
- The bot lacks required permissions (see Bot Requirements above)

**"Application did not respond"**
- Usually indicates a configuration issue with the bot or AWS infrastructure

### Troubleshooting

1. **Commands not appearing:** Ensure slash commands are registered
2. **Permission errors:** Check bot role hierarchy and permissions
3. **Webhook errors:** Verify Discord webhook URL configuration
4. **Database errors:** Check AWS CloudWatch logs for details
